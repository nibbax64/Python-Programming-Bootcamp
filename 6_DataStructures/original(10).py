# In this video I'll focus on how you would delete nodes
# in a Binary Tree. This is the most complicated task
# you can perform with trees so refer to the tree diagrams
# while I cover the coding involved.

# Walkthrough Delete Root
# 1. Ask is the node we want to delete the Root?
# 2. If it is ask what is the right child of Root?
# 3. The right child will replace Root
# 4. Take the Roots left child and assign it as the left
# child to Roots right child

# Walkthrough Roots Left Child
# 1. Is the left child < Root? (We do this to determine if we
# are going to the left or right of Root)
# 2. The left child will be replaced by its right child
# 3. We do this by assigning 25s right child as the left child
# of Root
# 4. Then assign 25s left child as the left child of 30
